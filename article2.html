            <h1>Typography as Discourse</h1>

                <p>The recent history of graphic design in the United States reveals a series of  actions and reactions. The ﬁfties saw the ﬂowering of U.S. graphic design in the New York School. This copy-concept and image-oriented direction was challenged in the sixties by the importation of Swiss minimalism, a structural and typographic system that forced a split between graphic design and advertising. Predictably, designers in the next decade rebelled against Helvetica  and the grid system that had become the ofﬁcial American corporate style.</p>

                <p>In the early seventies, Robert Venturi’s Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture emerged alongside the study of graphic design history as  inﬂuences on American graphic design students. Simultaneously, Switzerland’s Basel school was transformed by Wolfgang Weingart’s syntactical experimentation, an enthusiasm that quickly spread to U.S. schools.  Academia’s rediscovery of early-twentieth-century Modernism, the appearance of historicized and vernacular architectural postmodernism, and the spread of Weingartian structural expressionism all came together in the graphic explosion labeled as New Wave.</p>

                <p>Shattering the constraints of minimalism was exhilarating and far more fun than the antiseptic discipline of the classical Swiss school. After a brief ﬂurry of diatribes in the graphic design press, this permissive new approach quickly moved into the professional mainstream. Today, however, the  maverick has been tamed, codiﬁed into a formalistic style that ﬁlls our design annuals with endlessly sophisticated renditions. What was originally a revolution is now an institution, as predictable as Beaux Arts architecture. It is the new status quo—the New Academy, as Phil Meggs calls it.</p>
